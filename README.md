# Data-Viz
Data visualization project  

Overview:  

This project will utilize functional visualizations of data using Matplotlib and Plotly. The project will also utilize data mining. This will help lead into more complicated projects such as machine learning and go along with learning Scikit and Pytorch in the future. Still need to work with Pandas.  

# Tasks Completed  

- Made histogram graph of the results from one and two dice rolling thousands of times using plotly  
- Made a random walk art with 200k data points split into 4 different walks on the same chart using matplotlib  
- Made line graph using matplotlib to graph squares of numbers  
- Made world map graphing global earthquake data including magnitude using plotly  
- Made line graph using climate data and compared the highs and lows utilizing matplotlib
- Datamined GitHub api to retrieve top starred repositores and displayed them in an interactive graph to show the top rated
